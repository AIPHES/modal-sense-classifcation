Mr President , may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and , from what I hear , the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report .	de
Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work .	de
Madam President , may I first thank Mr Graa Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry .	de
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock , if I may .	de
Two questions if I may .	de
If I may , however , just make a few comments on the method .	de
Mr President , may I begin by thanking Members of this Parliament very much indeed for the questions that they have put and the comments that they have made .	de
Mr President , may I begin by expressing the heartfelt thanks of the Commission for the work that has been done by Mrs Kauppi .	de
Just one comment if I may : I understand that on various occasions colleagues may want to test the quorum .	de
In all events , this moment is an historic moment for Greece and , may I say , for Europe too .	de
may I depart from normal practice by asking you to pay greater attention to the allocated time slots .	de
may I turn to some of the detailed areas in the particular proposals that the Commission has asked Parliament to comment upon .	de
Mr President , may I begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Skinner , for the excellent work he has done in drafting this report .	de
Madam President , I will quickly mention some other issues , if I may , to confirm or expand upon what the Presidency has said .	de
Mr President , may I , on behalf of the European Liberal Democrats , thank and congratulate Mr Oostlander . His was a well prepared report .	de
If I may , I should like to make two proposals and one request to the Commission .	de
Mr President , may I thank the Commissioner very much for his very positive reply about cooperation with Parliament .	de
Mr President , Commissioner , first may I also associate myself strongly with the remarks made by my colleague , Mr Galeote , with regard to terrorism .	de
Mr President , I would like to counsel , if I may , Mr Solana and my very good friend Commissioner Patten to exercise caution in relation to the Middle East at this present time .	de
And may I ask : how do they know ?	de
may they be kept locked up for a suitable period of time to deter them from being so stupid in the future !	de
Mr President , first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a most balanced report and then , if I may , I should like to comment on a strategic point which particularly concerns me .	de
Mr President , may I introduce a further thought ?	de
Mr President , may I say that I am totally dissatisfied with the Council representative ' s reply . First of all , I asked a straightforward question .	de
may I thank the Commission for an excellent initiative on our relationship with the UN .	de
Perhaps I may for once breach protocol and also mention John Ryan who has been active for years in the Commission on this matter and has played a crucial part .	de
Mr President , I would like to make one comment , if I may , on the reform of the labour markets .	de
Even so , if I may , I would firstly like to ask about the timing of this initiative , which is scheduled a few months prior to the re-launch of the WTO negotiations .	de
Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , may I again thank the three rapporteurs on behalf of my group .	de
Madam President , after the serious business may I end on a lighter note , with some good news for the region I represent , the north-west of England .	de
Mr President , may I begin by saying that the Commission welcomes this report on the operation of the European works councils directive .	de
may I run over time slightly in order to pay my respects and offer my thanks to all the members who have patiently fought to make headway here over the years , long before my arrival here .	de
Mr President , may I thank Mr Watson on behalf of our committee for bringing this report to plenary .	de
Mr President , if I may , I would like to examine two parts of the report presented to Parliament . I wish to comment on Recital H and Article 1 e ) .	de
Mr President , if I may , I shall answer all three at the same time .	de
Mr President , may I begin by saying that this proposal deals with the second pillar of this convention involving public participation in environmental decision-taking .	de
Madam President , may I ask why the most radical amendment , No 23 , is not being put to the vote first ?	de
This brought to an end some quite considerable work by Mrs Maij-Weggen , and also , if I may say so , by Mr Cashman .	de
If I may , I would like to thank in particular the Secretary-General , Mr Julian Priestley , and all those working here who have helped me with their extraordinary degree of motivation and friendship .	de
may I also point out that , in my personal opinion , certain aspects of the proposed GMES programme involve strategic activities .	de
Mr President , may I briefly put a question to Commissioner Bolkestein ?	de
Mr President , I would like , if I may , to make some comments that have been inspired by this report .	de
First of all , if I may , I would like to stress that the responsibility for this falls to the Member States themselves .	de
Mr President , first of all may I say that I have much sympathy with the remarks that have just been passed by Mr Harbour .	de
may I say , Commissioner De Palacio , that these remarks naturally do not apply to the chapters for which you are responsible but to other chapters in this and other papers .	de
If I may use commercial language , the UN is actually a brand .	de
I would like to raise two very brief points if I may , Mr President .	de
It appears that the general issues have already been dealt with and I would therefore like , if I may , just to focus on Slovenia .	de
may I say that I am personally confident of the fact that an agreement between the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission will be achieved on these issues .	de
I will now , if I may , read out the key points of the recommendations we adopted today .	de
may I add a few examples ?	de
But Mrs Schreyer is speaking later , if you wish her to deal with this matter then she may - it will be entirely up to her .	de
Mr President , may I start by saying how delighted I am to see the new generation of Europe in the visitors ' gallery following this debate , which directly affects their future .	de
I would like , if I may , Mr President , to address the Belarusian Head of State .	de
For the threshold value below which contaminated seeds may nonetheless be put on the market , the most recent state of the art must alone be decisive .	de
Finally , may I congratulate the Greek Presidency on the sensitivity and readiness it demonstrated in convening the Extraordinary Council .	de
may I finally say to the Council that its statement contravened the facts .	de
Mr President , may I point out that it is pronounced Duin , as in Duisburg .	de
Then there is the section on external aid , which I will comment on , if I may , during the second part of the debate .	de
I would point out , if I may , that , even if he were prepared to do so , the Commission would not want blind trust to be placed in it at all .	de
If I may , I should like to make a number of additional comments regarding the situation in that country .	de
may I remind you in this connection of the agreements that were concluded at the European Summit in The Hague two years ago ?	de
may I take this opportunity to mention once again today the historic significance of the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 .	de
may I also thank the rapporteurs .	de
may I return to two of them , which seem to be especially significant .	de
It goes on to say that for such goods Member States ' may enable the parties to agree to a shortened period of liability ' , that is shorter than 2 years .	de

I have some reservations , in that if you abolish extradition what you put in its place may not be effective .	ep
Europol may well be using pirated information technology .	ep
You may have beaten the record .	ep
They are in a position of occupational dependence and may face a conflict of interest between loyalty towards their employers and respect for ethical standards .	ep
Citizens may find this difficult to understand when they encounter problems with Community law .	ep
With regard to harmful substances that may be found in honey for industry or baker ' s honey , we think that it should be forbidden for them to be present in honey .	ep
We may be facing terrible times ahead but it is essential that we have the courage as well as the compassion to consider carefully the alternatives .	ep
Some may appreciate in these circumstances that a plea for this does not point to an institutional compulsion , but rather to a concern for the effectiveness of the Union ' s actions .	ep
This may be part of the reason why the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report unanimously .	ep

I am afraid that the Commission may have gone beyond what was agreed at Tampere .	ep
It may also be the time to question whether some production methods are not perhaps obsolete .	ep
It may also be the case that a cup of cocoa and a bedtime story are essential for everyone but this is not something which should be done at EU level .	ep
I understand I may have created concern because , when faced with such clear evidence of a process , Parliament may say , ' But that is our job ! '	ep
Thirdly , we may well have disregarded or underestimated the importance of one of our tasks .	ep
In the light of this , it may have been more appropriate to postpone the discussion of these reports because they do not take into consideration recent international developments .	ep

Of course it is no bad thing , it may even be a good thing , that in many cases it is available to users free of charge .	ep

It may be the case that weapons are necessary , but we must be clear that other things are also required .	ep
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr President , I believe I have answered as fully as possible although I may well have omitted some aspects .	ep
In terms of the long view politically and economically , we may also be able to establish a better legal system with a stronger UN .	ep

I can express my personal views , which may be of interest to you , but they will not make the slightest difference because they do not convey the position of the Council .	ep
I said that we do not have a list of the rulings which Turkey may have failed to observe .	ep
It is already foreseeable that some Member States that were very keen on producing a standard form , especially at the outset , will want to go their own way and may take a different route in future .	ep
For our point of view , this continual prevarication and threat that there will be no agreement and coordination after all , or that there may be recourse to violence once more , are incomprehensible and unacceptable .	ep
Statistics will tell us that it should not be very difficult to do it much better , which may not even be good enough , but definitely it is an opportunity .	ep
From a situation in which there was a total refusal to engage in dialogue , discussions have now taken place , and a process of reconciliation may be underway .	ep
Obviously there is , and may continue to be , disagreement .	ep

Mr President , you may not , but Mrs Fontaine certainly will be aware of the following matter which we have raised in the European Parliament , time and again , over the last ten years .	ep
Council is discussing the proposals put forward by the Commission ; Parliament , which desperately needs powers of codecision , may be reconsulted on this matter .	ep

I know that this directive may not be the place for such detailed information , however , in the absence of any movement from the operators , I believe it is important for us to highlight this issue .	ep
The Council seems to have taken an interest in this , and it may be wise to be a little less generous next time than we were this year .	ep
This would at the very least prevent us from voting on out-of-date documents as we did in November , or only nodding our assent retrospectively , which we may do this week .	ep

This may be the first time that this House has heard a political statement from the Council which goes much further than the usual strictly formal statements on the conflict in the Western Sahara .	ep

Without a doubt , the Human Rights Commission gets results every year , even though these may not be as far-reaching as our own ambitions and aspirations .	ep
It may not work as well as we would expect or like it to , but it is a policy that yields results .	ep
But I do not want to dwell on this study because others may dispute it .	ep
Therefore , the Commission considers that this second paragraph of Article 299 of the Treaty is the appropriate legal basis for these proposals and any others which may arise in the future .	ep

Therefore , Europe may well do better to focus on the deep-rooted causes of the unmanageable problem of illegal immigration rather than on the symptoms .	ep
We may have to do this eventually but not yet .	ep
I also wonder whether there may be a need for some form of EU function to guarantee the Rule of Law which I seek and on which the Commission will clearly be drawing up proposals .	ep
It may be that we could have been a little more ambitious , for example as regards the new techniques that science has placed at the disposal of women 's health and reproductive rights .	ep

Since 11 September , approaches have been adopted that may be understandable but are nevertheless dangerous .	ep
We call for respect for international conventions . It may be that some of them need to be reworked and revised , and they must genuinely be revised , not set aside .	ep
On this last point , Members may recall that the Asia-Europe Co-operation Framework 2000 introduced the two-key consensus principle .	ep

We require of our exporters that they respect the Cartagena Protocol and so , too , the legislation that other countries may adopt and that may go further than the European Union 's .	ep
Their fear appears to be that , with pressure from democratic grass-roots movements already voicing their opinion in numerous countries , the Member States may not fall into line with this dire legislation .	ep
One of the reasons for this is that if we do not put in significant amounts the European Union may not have a seat at the table - a seat on the board .	ep
The second line which may require additional appropriations is the Cohesion Fund .	ep
The money may not be flowing into the right channels , but that is why there is a need for reform .	ep
Transport chains that may also involve transportation by road must also be included .	ep

And ultimately , this is the underlying reason for my final rejection of the report , which should serve as a warning for the future : in striving to achieve too much , the basic needs may suffer .	ep

Mr President , it may be incorrect to say this , but democratisation of the Islamic world is crucial for the security of the Western world .	ep
I can fully understand that the USA may have difficulty in respecting us , as we do not dare back our many fine words up with force .	ep
Any other type of response or intervention that may have taken place , in any case , does not fall within the competence of this Presidency and I cannot enter into a discussion on the matter .	ep
However , we can accept Amendment No 40 - which Mrs Maes mentioned a moment ago - because it makes our position more flexible and means that we offer quantities which may be more balanced .	ep
You may recall that at a previous debate I took inspiration from the late , great Elvis Presley when he said ' it 's now or never ' .	ep

Colin Powell , his Secretary of State , implied the United States may impose new sanctions in addition to an existing travel ban affecting Mr. Mugabe 's inner circle .	ep
Mr. Williams says '' neither the US nor Australia is in a position to begin a prosecution against Hicks , '' acknowledging that he may not have committed any offenses under Australian law .	ep
Potential terrorists may well be concealed among them , but for the great majority , it is common knowledge that the United States is a land of freedom and opportunity -- the preferred destination of the world 's emigrants for the better part of the past two centuries .	ep
Let me pause only briefly to allow that America is imperfect , like all earthly things ; that its governments and people have committed many sins ; that might does not make right ; that power and wealth are not good in themselves ; that goodness , truth and beauty may be found in every country and town .	ep
The rail car , installed outside the International Space Station on the crew 's first spacewalk , will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second , but ground controllers may not open up the throttle all the way in their first test today anyway .	ep

Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics , not for military purposes , but with strictly humanitarian ends .	ep
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs .	ep
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war .	ep

As you know better than anyone , funds are fully allocated and there are no generalised fund surpluses , even though there may be specific instances where there are no budgetary implementations .	ep
For many institutions , this approach may be neither desirable nor appropriate and , of course , its use must never be compulsory .	ep
The Commission may have perfectly good reasons for not doing so , but we would like to know what they are .	ep
He may also hear Romano Prodi 's intervention , I do not know , but he would not hear the remarks of the group Chairmen .	ep
