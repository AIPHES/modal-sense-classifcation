As consensus must be reached at Doha , however , giving in to the United States and the Cairns Group by abandoning our farmers to the productivist and ultraliberal global market is not an adequate approach .	de
In the light of the enlargement , every effort must be made to achieve this also in the candidate countries in the shortest possible time .	de
We must have clear European standards and European measuring methods .	de
We must pay special attention to this issue in order to adequately weigh up the different actions relating to the forests : prevention , improvement , conservation and the restoration of burnt areas and forestation .	de
We must therefore set up a true system of ports of refuge and safe ports of anchorage where damage can be limited . We welcome this proposal , although we have tightened it up slightly .	de
In the peripheral regions too , we must treat the riches of the sea that we have been given sensibly .	de
We must strive for a policy which can meet quite a few different objectives at the same time . We must weigh immediate needs against the long-term consequences of decisions and their impact outside the EU .	de
The production of energy and the cultivation of energy crops offer an alternative income-generation opportunity for our farmers in Europe , which must be exploited .	de
There must be standardised rules across Europe to allow victims of the traffic in human beings and domestic slavery to escape their persecutors .	de
In connection with the Macedonian peace proposal , the Macedonian parliament must hold a debate as a matter of urgency .	de
That is why agreements must be made globally , preferably in the context of the World Trade Organisation .	de
There must be mutual recognition .	de
More importantly , however , we must make firm proposals that seek to put an end to these despicable acts .	de
Air traffic has increased considerably and we must treat safety issues with particular attention .	de
We must , at long last , move away from our non-vaccination policy .	de
There must also be increasing cooperation between intelligence services and a strengthening of Europol .	de
And we must do so jointly with the United States .	de
It is becoming ever clearer that the response must be measured and proportionate , and the consequences for all must be anticipated and planned .	ep
A military and intelligence response must , in any case , be accompanied by an incisive Union policy in the areas where there is worst crisis : an action intended to extinguish the flames of desperation and intolerance .	de
An extra effort must therefore be made to ensure that it is the job and the responsibilities , and not the individual ' s gender , which decide how much he or she is paid .	de
We must improve how the system works .	de
There must be an increase in openness and public control .	de
We must build upon a clear division of power in which political responsibility can be insisted upon .	de
We had insisted on the need for decisions to be made quickly , but in every case we must first consult Parliament fully .	de
There must be an equal balance of effort and sharing of responsibility to prevent both forum shopping by asylum seekers and ' pass the parcel ' by Member States .	de
The Council must certainly be made aware of this .	de
I should like to highlight this sector in particular , because we are still a long way from having the really efficient network of libraries in Europe that is an absolute must .	de
If we are to succeed , we must have the backing of a broad coalition , under the aegis of the United Nations .	de
It tells us that we must populate Europe because Europe has a population deficit .	de
We must have adequate education , monitoring and research .	de
There must be proper legal protection of foreign investments and investors in Vietnam and the corruption there must be brought to an end .	de
We must also accelerate the completion of security programmes relating to checks on hold luggage and ensure that our decisions have been implemented .	de
And in the knowledge that 314 votes must be attained , you should have acted more wisely .	de
The European fisheries policy must be brought much more closely in line with European development policy .	de
We must increase competition at ports .	de
As it is difficult to recycle plastic , something must be done about this .	de
Political decisions must be based on sound data , and the directive must be adapted accordingly .	de
In European research , we must take a step forward both qualitatively and quantitatively speaking .	de
I agree with Mr Poettering that Europe must speak with one voice .	de
There must be a genuine rethink of transport policy at European level .	de
There must be a swift , impartial , effective inquiry into these massacres .	de
We must also have a proper evaluation of the year in clear and simple language , and in accessible formats .	de
We must have mechanisms in place to stop this recurring year on year .	de
We must have effective administration and make sure that people regain their confidence in the European Union .	de
We must be prepared for a long haul .	de
Mr President , the Honourable Member must understand that it is impossible for me to answer such detailed questions .	ep
However , the fact that no decisions have been taken on the future of the Galileo European satellite navigation project is a regrettable example of what we must avoid .	de
We must also have instruments of political cooperation .	de
We must introduce an integrated policy through genuine cooperation at international level , whilst striving hard not to give in to a lax attitude , which would have a detrimental effect on our work .	de
We must have improved scientific information : there can be no broad-brush approach , as has been said .	de
We must take a different approach , where the public services are provided by public companies and monitored by the citizens .	de
I fully agree that we must have predictable accepted methodologies so that anybody can assess how we have come to these conclusions .	de
We must have more PCs at school per student .	de
Insupportable debts must be substantially lowered , and the Debt Repayment Fund must be adequate for this .	de
The point I made in my speech in the debate was that it is not enough to have common agreement to respect rights ; you must have effective remedies .	de
We must now gather support from the international community for those measures .	de
We must check this very carefully , and we must ensure once again that these competences are returned either to national parliaments or to the European Parliament .	de
This is an aspect that the national authorities must focus on , without fail , in order to enhance the attraction of Structural Funds in the private sector .	de
If we are to be able to create a dynamic and competitive Europe , then deregulation , liberalisation , structural changes and tax reductions must be implemented .	de
The Socrates Programme must be managed efficiently , and this also includes coordination with other European programmes .	de
There must also be the vision of ' living together ' , of solidarity between rich regions and poorer regions , and of access for everyone to a number of fundamental rights .	de
We must set up this internal market for food supplements .	de
Customers who must have money .	de
We must now have the last question to the President-in-Office of the Council , because he must leave at 7 p.m. on the dot to catch his flight .	de
The European Union must agree to prioritise growth and employment , promoting the genuine integration of the economies of the Member States .	de
In this case - and I must stress this , as it may be an issue on which Mr Oostlander and myself do not agree - the national administrations are the key players in this programme .	de
There must be a bilateral solution , urgently required , supported by the new Dublin II but reached through pragmatic bilateral agreement .	de
Children who are left alone to flee from war and oppression must receive all the support we can give them .	de
In order that co-operation is as close as possible , there must be an exchange of personal data of those few who pose a threat to security .	de
The plan for funding this process , through specialised sections of the EIB now and a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank in the future , must be welcomed with open arms .	de
Actual steps must be taken in order to ensure that this is done .	de
Firstly , we must have a detailed survey on the international mobility of students , since none exists at the moment .	de
This is certainly a major challenge - a challenge for the Europe of culture and values - which we cannot afford not to take up and in which we must succeed .	de
We do not want to hear once again , Mr President , that Europe must have a foreign policy .	de
If the objective of reducing the fishing fleet is successfully to be achieved , policy must be radically revised .	de
We must have a standardisation of sampling , reporting and the way in which these matters are dealt with .	de
However , before taking any legislative measures , we must identify the reasons why the food chain has been downgraded and adulterated .	de
Mr de Miguel , I completely share your view that a better description must be produced and that the budget must be planned more effectively .	de
The Union must have its own competence in matters involving economic policy , and it must have a redefined framework for the coordination of national policies , as well as fiscal harmonisation of the budgetary and revenue tools .	de
This situation must change , and it must be based on greater coordination among the Member States themselves and greater involvement by them and the European Union in the various stages of United Nations programmes .	de
We can distribute responsibility around the various Member States , but we must have a coordinated policy .	de
We must develop a policy that will work .	de
Fourthly , a VAT level must be set which is harmonised at European level .	de
The good cause is not served by duplication . The distribution of tasks must be clear .	de
We must have time to discover how we are to resolve this matter .	de
We must also review policy in areas in which we know that we are at present , in actual fact , harming poor countries in particular .	de
Europe must become more innovative .	de
We must set up a true common asylum and immigration policy .	de
We must have Rules of Procedure which reflect a positive view of family and children , something not expressed by the present Rules .	de
We must also prepare a reserve plan to cover the contingency of there being a ' no ' vote in Ireland .	de
We must deal with this report with enthusiasm and not become discouraged , because the positions seem so opposed that an agreement appears impossible .	de
In order to promote the use of biofuels , a tax incentive must be introduced .	de
The EU and the Member States must make far greater efforts in the field of de-escalation .	de
There must be labelling and transparency .	de
There must be guidelines regarding ingredients .	de
We must definitely have data based on research regarding which materials improve the state of the environment most and in which circumstances .	de
We must continue with the campaign against violence and with preventive measures .	de
Mr President , I shall just speak very briefly to tell Mr De Keyser that he must have been wrongly informed .	ep
I reiterate that the EU must have a consistent approach and should not extradite individuals to countries where they may be at risk of incurring the death penalty .	de
As you must be aware , the Protocol we are to debate today is linked to the European Community 's recently implemented ratification of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety .	ep
You must agree that it will be an important project for years to come .	ep
There must therefore , of course , be better coordination , and I am able to welcome the initiatives the Commission is working on in this area .	de
We must have institutions that fight for citizens ' rights in the EU .	de
We must have colleagues who show that they are in favour of securing citizens ' rights , but that is not enough in itself .	de
These must be conducted with the full participation of local people and we must have the results of those impact assessments before negotiations start .	de
My group is deeply worried that corruption remains widespread and that much work must be done to implement the acquis in justice and home affairs .	de
In other words , they must not necessarily be changed each year .	de
We must have proper democratic control .	de
It must also be a political association . In other words , we must get used to addressing all global political issues together with our Mediterranean partners .	de
And an increase - as the rapporteurs have said - in the monitoring of pharmaceuticals , because the effects of medication do not end with authorisation , and furthermore there must be continued monitoring .	de
Firstly , because the European Commission had the courage to tackle head on a considerable and practical problem which , whether you like it or not , must be resolved .	de
The EU must create sustainable fishing which can survive in the long term .	de
We must have similar access to other working parties ' working documents and minutes , and we must have access immediately so that we can follow developments before the laws are adopted .	de
When supervision and operation are handed over to the various directorates-general , they must be monitored effectively .	de
I believe that there must be tough rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest among financial journalists .	de
We must have the full and fair implementation of the Copenhagen criteria in political and economic matters .	de
We must take account of other indicators that are just as relevant and quantifiable , such as accessibility , public infrastructures and employment rates .	de
To avoid deliberately upsetting nature , we must draft effective climate policy .	de
This is , in my view , a clear and transparent stance , which we must sustain at all costs .	de
A safeguard clause must therefore be included .	de
We must have time and the proper analysis of how the process has been functioning .	de
We must reach an interinstitutional agreement .	de
I say that if the scientists cannot go and argue their case in the Irish Sea then it must not be a scientific case that they are really arguing .	ep
The European Parliament must achieve greater participation without necessarily demanding the right to make decisions .	de
The Commission must do this in a much more focused way .	de
We really must be allowed enough time .	de
Yes , there must be emergency action plans .	de
We must introduce a global dimension , a clear statement must be issued by the OIE and there must be effective monitoring of imports , including at airports .	de
We must introduce a global dimension , a clear statement must be issued by the OIE and there must be effective monitoring of imports , including at airports .	de
The first thing we must do is understand .	de
It must be diverse if it is to be democratic .	de
We must have this .	de
We must also have a compensation rule for ports or places of refuge that take in ships .	de
We must not only have a common goal but also a common working method , and I am somewhat stricter than you are when it comes to discouraging new national rules .	de
All players must have a management system , and there must be common safety certificates for staff , for rolling stock and also for the infrastructure manager .	de
This difficult process must also be given more political support , and it is a pity that business must sacrifice flexibility for the sake of regulation , flexibility being the keyword in the sector .	de
In concentrating the services in one or two main players we must be sure that we do not risk security in the event of institutional collapse .	de
In order to exert maximum influence , coordination must take place with the United States on as many aspects as possible .	de
Moreover , there must be safeguards to ensure that we do not encourage the use of marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry .	de
This must be explained .	de
We must therefore create a new binding international legal instrument , not just to further and promote cultural diversity but to establish trade rules for cultural goods and services too .	de
On culture - less than 0.5 % of total expenditure - we must have an effective procedure for the A-30 lines .	de
We must have a policy that is able to accommodate the different levels of economic development and of commitment to our value system .	de
We must be more ambitious and more decisive if we are to resolve the causes of inequality , violence and poverty .	de
In the final analysis , we must have a decision , within Europe , on the real nature of our Treaties .	de
We must have a second UN resolution , we must have a clear timetable in order to say inspectors can go on for so long but no further .	de
We must have a second UN resolution , we must have a clear timetable in order to say inspectors can go on for so long but no further .	de
We must have an adequate fishing industry .	de
Particular attention must be paid to women who find it harder to achieve equality of opportunity , such as women with disabilities , immigrants and heads of families .	de
The UN needs to be reformed , and we must get a broad discussion under way about what international law really entails and about how it might be able to protect people in future .	de
We must not have agencies just so that all the Member States can have their ' baby ' .	de
Our accounting must be on an accrual basis .	de
In fact , we must make further efforts to ensure that the programme can be a real option for everyone and indeed , why should it not become a normal part of university education in Europe ?	de
As you must already know , Parliament , together with the Commission , will make up the delegation from the Community , which has observer status with the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs .	ep
Those procedures must therefore be changed in one way or another , in spite of all the mediation that has taken place in the meantime .	de
If the curious consumer wishes to know more , they must consult the manufacturer by way of the latter 's web site and by telephone .	de
Secondly , the criteria must be clear .	de
We must implement a new policy which integrates all European actions .	de
The role of public health in the Treaty really must be laid down and reinforced now .	de
We must also have joint travel advice because there certainly is something the matter .	de
It must be put on a sound financial footing .	de
We must have proper checks on the readiness and the value of our contingency plan .	de
We must have the resources , knowledge and personnel to react quickly .	de
We must have a concerted , organised and united approach to prevent illegal imports .	de
We must use a proper map , a genuine maritime-style map .	de
The least-favoured areas must be given special intention in view of the impact the total decoupling of aid will have on them .	de
Other elements must be added to them however .	de
We must have an early-warning system in place to pinpoint areas of potential disagreement at the earliest possible moment .	de
This Parliament has a central role to play in this and must take on board its responsibilities , but the Council and the Commission must give us greater cooperation .	de
However , to do that it must set aside the ethnic differences of the north and south , outlaw the extremes of Sharia law and work together towards economic prosperity .	de
To do that we need very clear and detailed rules , but there must be a level playing field across Europe , and in this case that means a harmonised and more effective method of testing .	de
One of them must have a majority in the European Parliament , but Parliament cannot elect a second .	de
At the same time , there must be a reliable verification system .	de
Not everyone was in agreement with all the points in the report , but that does not prevent me from wanting the debate to continue , because it must exist .	de
If the citizens of Europe want a constitution , there must be a constitutive process based on democracy , social rights , public services and the general interest .	de
Although we are taking the new Member States into full consideration , the regions in the current Member States needing special support must also be included in any new plans .	de
There must be a regional policy .	de
This means that we must stand united .	de
The definition must be clear so that the citizens can understand these competences and it must be transparent so that these are not open to interpretation by institutions that might have a more opaque way of doing things .	de
Europe must have prisons that are fit for human beings .	de
Although I do feel that such an agency would be useful , we must stop and think before launching such an undertaking .	de
We must ensure support for these languages by making use of the possibilities provided by the existing programmes .	de
There must also be a necessary reserve of key energy products in stock .	de
Our willingness to use the euro in the European Union must be confirmed and increased every day .	de
The European Union must not set up an organisation in parallel with NATO .	de
First of all , there must be a balance between social and economic considerations .	de
We must show solidarity with future generations .	de
The Commission is working on this area , but we must time things carefully .	de
We need clear criteria for the awarding of subsidies to organisations and projects , and these must be clearly publicised , so that the applicants know where they stand .	de
There must be more investment in clean sources of energy and energy saving and that must also manifest itself in the budget .	de
And push we must .	de
There must also be cultural autonomy for Tibet .	de
We must have a successful debate on this .	de
We must take immediate , concerted action to support the victims .	de
We must have a single start date .	de
Europe must continue to grow so that new jobs can be created .	de
Romania must not be afraid of the Hungarians .	de
We must have a referendum .	de
The Council and these three proposals must therefore be supported .	de
A rigorous measurement framework , widely agreed and adopted by the industry , is a must to quantify the real benefits of information and communication technologies .	de
That is what must be done .	de
In the face of third parties , common tariffs must be matched with common customs .	de
The most important thing is that people absolutely must have the right to know and to make their own choice about the food they eat .	de
We must , therefore , be more innovative to convince European citizens and make them our allies .	de
In addition , the loser must be given the means to make his criticism known to the voters .	de
We must have a system for registering cattle and a control system which ensures that the legislation is complied with .	de
We must have their support .	de
That is not necessarily the case under this regulation , but we must create an instrument to do so very quickly .	de
We must have an agreement .	de
We must have equitable agreements with other countries .	de

In order to be effective , it must be well anchored in the Member States ' national authorities .	de
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .	de
Admittedly , there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund , IOPCF , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .	de
Current programmes must be accelerated .	de
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .	de
There is a willingness but fear pervades , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union .	de
We must therefore find a political solution .	de
We must create joint , interregional and transnational management bodies , in which all local and regional authorities , as well as economic and social operators , play an active role .	de
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this .	de
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the " them and us " syndrome .	de
In order to achieve this strategic direction , there must be an institutional alliance which transcends the natural differences of political opinion .	de
We must without doubt take up the challenges laid down in this report , but must also institute a genuine Community policy on conservation and sustainable management .	de
Ports must be equipped with reception facilities .	de
When it comes to protecting health and the environment we must be ambitious if we really want to improve the situation .	de
We must bring the new standard into force as soon as possible . It is in our interests to do so , but what we are lacking is commitment on the part of the Americans .	de
Political dialogue must be structured and take the form of regular consultations .	de
I believe we must adopt an open and transparent strategy here , so that we can say in all candour how we dealt with the funding that was made available to the groups .	de
I share his opinion but , given the cross-border nature of the problem , the response must be at Union level .	de
We therefore move the inadmissibility of this report which , in addition to having a dubious legal basis , was not properly prepared and does not enjoy the broad consensus which Europe must have .	de
We must strike a balance . This is necessary if our citizens are to have confidence in European cooperation .	de
We must have a majority of two thirds of the Member States , even if that means providing at the same time for a simple majority of Member States representing a majority of the total EU population .	de
The application and control of Community legislation is also important . The Member States must cooperate in this application .	de
Where operations are concerned , we must have a method which is fast and legally correct and which permits transparency , and we must therefore have a more regular budgetary procedure .	de
Where operations are concerned , we must have a method which is fast and legally correct and which permits transparency , and we must therefore have a more regular budgetary procedure .	de
This anomaly must be resolved without delay .	de
A major effort must be made in terms of harmonisation and simplification of rules .	de
I am in favour of this report but I do not agree with its hypocrisy . We must be more courageous !	de
The situation regarding competition in the fixed networks must also be radically improved .	de
There are a whole range of activities connected to the tobacco industry , which we must protect at all costs .	de
We must therefore have cross-border cooperation to prevent the trade from developing .	de
We must obtain relevant and reliable information which can be compared .	de
It is our view that the IGC must succeed , that it is absolutely crucial that it succeeds , but not at any price .	de
Recent events have given us grounds to think that these are possible consequences , which must be prevented at all costs .	de
Of course , we must have clear information permitting full traceability from farm to plate .	de
The regulation on the subject of the Community ' s forests must be reformed , but Parliament cannot undertake financial commitments until the present regulation expires in 2001 .	de
We must have good coordination between the assistance agreement , which has recently been debated here in the Chamber , and the rules concerning money laundering .	de
If anybody wants to attach themselves to it , they must have the agreement of all the groups which have produced the text .	de
A common approach must be adopted to address these problems . In its Helsinki report , the Commission clearly signalled that it cannot solve all these problems by its own efforts alone .	de
I repeat that we must have a minimum degree of internal coherence in our policies .	de
Mr President , there must be a common and effective EU contribution to the success of the UN World Conference Against Racism next year and its European preparatory conference next month .	de
This is a fight which must engage us all and which must be able , specifically , to count on the participation of the European Parliament in defining the strategies to adopt and the priorities to set .	de
They must have a sound and responsible administration , staffed by men and women who are trained in Community procedures and in budgetary rules .	de
Controls must be tightened up , and the ultimate use to which exported arms are put must be strictly monitored In a word , the trade in death must stop .	de
Firstly , we must promote the development at national level of information and awareness-raising policies targeting families and the world of education in general .	de
There is one point which I must stress in particular .	de
I do not know if it will be under the urgent procedure but , in essence , it must be as quickly as possible .	de
The text of the Treaties must be comprehensible , above all from the point of view of the citizens .	de
The EU must acquire a credible foreign policy . We cannot rely upon the United States forever more .	de
More importantly , we must learn from this latest experience .	de
I also wish to say that there must be solid grounds for bans within the single market .	de
Commissioner , Minister , we must have strict controls in order to guarantee that specified risk materials are separated out throughout the entire animal food chain .	de
The CAP must be reorganised to encourage farmers .	de
As there is still a lot of uncertainty , we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken .	de
We must provide a broad definition of a support system and therefore cannot accept Amendments Nos 16 and 19 .	de
This is why more women must be involved in negotiations , in prevention operations , in management ...	de
We must instigate a major debate among the citizens of Europe , getting them involved in our debates . My third point concerns participation .	de
We must have a full picture of all parties ' responsibilities and hence of their liability .	de
In order for Treaty reform , and indeed enlargement , to be a success it must have the full support of the people .	de
The EU must acquire a common constitution .	de
Mr President , given the economic and geopolitical importance of Russia , the European Union believes it must seek a common strategy on the subject .	de
More humanitarian aid must be delivered .	de
A framework directive on postal services in Europe must therefore be drawn up as quickly as possible , since the Nice Summit gave the " green light " to this project .	de
We must produce a coordinated strategy for employment in conjunction with measures to counter discrimination on the grounds of age and modernise pensions and health schemes .	de
These are shortcomings that must be reviewed as a matter of priority .	de
European politics , military and civilian action must be coordinated effectively . This is another expectation which the world has of us , and rightly so .	de
However , measures must also be taken to avoid the obvious danger of information poverty .	de
As this becomes increasingly important , we must have an Institutional Agreement in which the role of Parliament is strengthened .	de
Secondly , we must continue to exert pressure on the Taliban regime so that it ceases its systematic crimes against human rights .	de
So this means that there must be a response , and a change of course , from the Heads of State and Government too .	de
We must , therefore , have an information policy that provides the Iraqi people with knowledge , so that this regime can finally be overthrown .	de
We must have the framework first and then look at how it is best implemented and whether such harmonisation is appropriate .	de
There must be a European-wide political agreement concerning the framework decision on the identification , seizure and confiscation of products of crime .	de
However , amendments have been proposed which seek to extend the Commission proposal even further . For example , the definition of public authorities must include agencies and legal persons acting on behalf of the public authorities .	de
Our citizens must receive sufficient training and so achieve good skills .	de
There must be strong , independent and open public research in the field so that there is also research into areas which are not of immediate commercial interest and into the problems and risks posed by the technology .	de
Whether it be this issue or the environment or the application of the precautionary principle , we must have the democratic freedom to be able to insist on some minimum standards acceptable to the majority of our citizens .	de
We must have access to more documents , and it is completely unacceptable that we should sit here in Parliament without knowing what our own ministers are saying and doing in the Council when they legislate .	de
There must be special grounds for exceptions to this rule .	de
We must have sustainable energy policies .	de
The economic policy of the Union must clearly be consistent with the principles of its employment policy and the social agenda .	de
We must have intelligent sanctions .	de
As the rapporteur says , the Commission must present rapid proposals for the safety of services .	de
As consensus must be reached at Doha , however , giving in to the United States and the Cairns Group by abandoning our farmers to the productivist and ultraliberal global market is not an adequate approach .	de
In the light of the enlargement , every effort must be made to achieve this also in the candidate countries in the shortest possible time .	de
We must have clear European standards and European measuring methods .	de
We must pay special attention to this issue in order to adequately weigh up the different actions relating to the forests : prevention , improvement , conservation and the restoration of burnt areas and forestation .	de
We must therefore set up a true system of ports of refuge and safe ports of anchorage where damage can be limited . We welcome this proposal , although we have tightened it up slightly .	de
In the peripheral regions too , we must treat the riches of the sea that we have been given sensibly .	de
We must strive for a policy which can meet quite a few different objectives at the same time . We must weigh immediate needs against the long-term consequences of decisions and their impact outside the EU .	de
The production of energy and the cultivation of energy crops offer an alternative income-generation opportunity for our farmers in Europe , which must be exploited .	de
There must be standardised rules across Europe to allow victims of the traffic in human beings and domestic slavery to escape their persecutors .	de
In connection with the Macedonian peace proposal , the Macedonian parliament must hold a debate as a matter of urgency .	de
That is why agreements must be made globally , preferably in the context of the World Trade Organisation .	de
There must be mutual recognition .	de
More importantly , however , we must make firm proposals that seek to put an end to these despicable acts .	de
Air traffic has increased considerably and we must treat safety issues with particular attention .	de
We must , at long last , move away from our non-vaccination policy .	de
There must also be increasing cooperation between intelligence services and a strengthening of Europol .	de
And we must do so jointly with the United States .	de
A military and intelligence response must , in any case , be accompanied by an incisive Union policy in the areas where there is worst crisis : an action intended to extinguish the flames of desperation and intolerance .	de
An extra effort must therefore be made to ensure that it is the job and the responsibilities , and not the individual ' s gender , which decide how much he or she is paid .	de
We must improve how the system works .	de
There must be an increase in openness and public control .	de
We must build upon a clear division of power in which political responsibility can be insisted upon .	de
We had insisted on the need for decisions to be made quickly , but in every case we must first consult Parliament fully .	de
There must be an equal balance of effort and sharing of responsibility to prevent both forum shopping by asylum seekers and ' pass the parcel ' by Member States .	de
The Council must certainly be made aware of this .	de
I should like to highlight this sector in particular , because we are still a long way from having the really efficient network of libraries in Europe that is an absolute must .	de
If we are to succeed , we must have the backing of a broad coalition , under the aegis of the United Nations .	de
It tells us that we must populate Europe because Europe has a population deficit .	de
We must have adequate education , monitoring and research .	de
There must be proper legal protection of foreign investments and investors in Vietnam and the corruption there must be brought to an end .	de
We must also accelerate the completion of security programmes relating to checks on hold luggage and ensure that our decisions have been implemented .	de
And in the knowledge that 314 votes must be attained , you should have acted more wisely .	de
The European fisheries policy must be brought much more closely in line with European development policy .	de
We must increase competition at ports .	de
As it is difficult to recycle plastic , something must be done about this .	de
Political decisions must be based on sound data , and the directive must be adapted accordingly .	de
In European research , we must take a step forward both qualitatively and quantitatively speaking .	de
I agree with Mr Poettering that Europe must speak with one voice .	de
There must be a genuine rethink of transport policy at European level .	de
There must be a swift , impartial , effective inquiry into these massacres .	de
We must also have a proper evaluation of the year in clear and simple language , and in accessible formats .	de
We must have mechanisms in place to stop this recurring year on year .	de
We must have effective administration and make sure that people regain their confidence in the European Union .	de
We must be prepared for a long haul .	de
However , the fact that no decisions have been taken on the future of the Galileo European satellite navigation project is a regrettable example of what we must avoid .	de
We must also have instruments of political cooperation .	de
We must introduce an integrated policy through genuine cooperation at international level , whilst striving hard not to give in to a lax attitude , which would have a detrimental effect on our work .	de
We must have improved scientific information : there can be no broad-brush approach , as has been said .	de
We must take a different approach , where the public services are provided by public companies and monitored by the citizens .	de
I fully agree that we must have predictable accepted methodologies so that anybody can assess how we have come to these conclusions .	de
We must have more PCs at school per student .	de
Insupportable debts must be substantially lowered , and the Debt Repayment Fund must be adequate for this .	de
The point I made in my speech in the debate was that it is not enough to have common agreement to respect rights ; you must have effective remedies .	de
We must now gather support from the international community for those measures .	de
We must check this very carefully , and we must ensure once again that these competences are returned either to national parliaments or to the European Parliament .	de
This is an aspect that the national authorities must focus on , without fail , in order to enhance the attraction of Structural Funds in the private sector .	de
If we are to be able to create a dynamic and competitive Europe , then deregulation , liberalisation , structural changes and tax reductions must be implemented .	de
The Socrates Programme must be managed efficiently , and this also includes coordination with other European programmes .	de
There must also be the vision of ' living together ' , of solidarity between rich regions and poorer regions , and of access for everyone to a number of fundamental rights .	de
We must set up this internal market for food supplements .	de
Customers who must have money .	de
We must now have the last question to the President-in-Office of the Council , because he must leave at 7 p.m. on the dot to catch his flight .	de
The European Union must agree to prioritise growth and employment , promoting the genuine integration of the economies of the Member States .	de
In this case - and I must stress this , as it may be an issue on which Mr Oostlander and myself do not agree - the national administrations are the key players in this programme .	de
There must be a bilateral solution , urgently required , supported by the new Dublin II but reached through pragmatic bilateral agreement .	de
Children who are left alone to flee from war and oppression must receive all the support we can give them .	de
In order that co-operation is as close as possible , there must be an exchange of personal data of those few who pose a threat to security .	de
The plan for funding this process , through specialised sections of the EIB now and a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank in the future , must be welcomed with open arms .	de
Actual steps must be taken in order to ensure that this is done .	de
Firstly , we must have a detailed survey on the international mobility of students , since none exists at the moment .	de
This is certainly a major challenge - a challenge for the Europe of culture and values - which we cannot afford not to take up and in which we must succeed .	de
We do not want to hear once again , Mr President , that Europe must have a foreign policy .	de
If the objective of reducing the fishing fleet is successfully to be achieved , policy must be radically revised .	de
We must have a standardisation of sampling , reporting and the way in which these matters are dealt with .	de
However , before taking any legislative measures , we must identify the reasons why the food chain has been downgraded and adulterated .	de
Mr de Miguel , I completely share your view that a better description must be produced and that the budget must be planned more effectively .	de
The Union must have its own competence in matters involving economic policy , and it must have a redefined framework for the coordination of national policies , as well as fiscal harmonisation of the budgetary and revenue tools .	de
This situation must change , and it must be based on greater coordination among the Member States themselves and greater involvement by them and the European Union in the various stages of United Nations programmes .	de
We can distribute responsibility around the various Member States , but we must have a coordinated policy .	de
We must develop a policy that will work .	de
Fourthly , a VAT level must be set which is harmonised at European level .	de
The good cause is not served by duplication . The distribution of tasks must be clear .	de
We must have time to discover how we are to resolve this matter .	de
We must also review policy in areas in which we know that we are at present , in actual fact , harming poor countries in particular .	de
Europe must become more innovative .	de
We must set up a true common asylum and immigration policy .	de
We must have Rules of Procedure which reflect a positive view of family and children , something not expressed by the present Rules .	de
We must also prepare a reserve plan to cover the contingency of there being a ' no ' vote in Ireland .	de
We must deal with this report with enthusiasm and not become discouraged , because the positions seem so opposed that an agreement appears impossible .	de
In order to promote the use of biofuels , a tax incentive must be introduced .	de
The EU and the Member States must make far greater efforts in the field of de-escalation .	de
There must be labelling and transparency .	de
There must be guidelines regarding ingredients .	de
We must definitely have data based on research regarding which materials improve the state of the environment most and in which circumstances .	de
We must continue with the campaign against violence and with preventive measures .	de
I reiterate that the EU must have a consistent approach and should not extradite individuals to countries where they may be at risk of incurring the death penalty .	de
There must therefore , of course , be better coordination , and I am able to welcome the initiatives the Commission is working on in this area .	de
We must have institutions that fight for citizens ' rights in the EU .	de
We must have colleagues who show that they are in favour of securing citizens ' rights , but that is not enough in itself .	de
These must be conducted with the full participation of local people and we must have the results of those impact assessments before negotiations start .	de
My group is deeply worried that corruption remains widespread and that much work must be done to implement the acquis in justice and home affairs .	de
In other words , they must not necessarily be changed each year .	de
We must have proper democratic control .	de
It must also be a political association . In other words , we must get used to addressing all global political issues together with our Mediterranean partners .	de
And an increase - as the rapporteurs have said - in the monitoring of pharmaceuticals , because the effects of medication do not end with authorisation , and furthermore there must be continued monitoring .	de
Firstly , because the European Commission had the courage to tackle head on a considerable and practical problem which , whether you like it or not , must be resolved .	de
The EU must create sustainable fishing which can survive in the long term .	de
We must have similar access to other working parties ' working documents and minutes , and we must have access immediately so that we can follow developments before the laws are adopted .	de
When supervision and operation are handed over to the various directorates-general , they must be monitored effectively .	de
I believe that there must be tough rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest among financial journalists .	de
We must have the full and fair implementation of the Copenhagen criteria in political and economic matters .	de
We must take account of other indicators that are just as relevant and quantifiable , such as accessibility , public infrastructures and employment rates .	de
To avoid deliberately upsetting nature , we must draft effective climate policy .	de
This is , in my view , a clear and transparent stance , which we must sustain at all costs .	de
A safeguard clause must therefore be included .	de
We must have time and the proper analysis of how the process has been functioning .	de
We must reach an interinstitutional agreement .	de
The European Parliament must achieve greater participation without necessarily demanding the right to make decisions .	de
The Commission must do this in a much more focused way .	de
We really must be allowed enough time .	de
Yes , there must be emergency action plans .	de
We must introduce a global dimension , a clear statement must be issued by the OIE and there must be effective monitoring of imports , including at airports .	de
We must introduce a global dimension , a clear statement must be issued by the OIE and there must be effective monitoring of imports , including at airports .	de
The first thing we must do is understand .	de
It must be diverse if it is to be democratic .	de
We must have this .	de
We must also have a compensation rule for ports or places of refuge that take in ships .	de
We must not only have a common goal but also a common working method , and I am somewhat stricter than you are when it comes to discouraging new national rules .	de
All players must have a management system , and there must be common safety certificates for staff , for rolling stock and also for the infrastructure manager .	de
This difficult process must also be given more political support , and it is a pity that business must sacrifice flexibility for the sake of regulation , flexibility being the keyword in the sector .	de
In concentrating the services in one or two main players we must be sure that we do not risk security in the event of institutional collapse .	de
In order to exert maximum influence , coordination must take place with the United States on as many aspects as possible .	de
Moreover , there must be safeguards to ensure that we do not encourage the use of marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry .	de
This must be explained .	de
We must therefore create a new binding international legal instrument , not just to further and promote cultural diversity but to establish trade rules for cultural goods and services too .	de
On culture - less than 0.5 % of total expenditure - we must have an effective procedure for the A-30 lines .	de
We must have a policy that is able to accommodate the different levels of economic development and of commitment to our value system .	de
We must be more ambitious and more decisive if we are to resolve the causes of inequality , violence and poverty .	de
