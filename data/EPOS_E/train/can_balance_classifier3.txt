How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?	dy
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention .	dy
Together , we can make the Lisbon Summit a success .	dy
If we can give people jobs this will prove to be the greatest weapon in the fight against social exclusion .	dy
The Commission is not able to accept these because they would place an additional burden upon those responsible and because no justification of their real value can be provided .	dy
How can we do this ? Biomass and hydroelectric power account for 95 % of renewable energy sources in the European Union .	dy
I believe we can do so without destroying biotechnology .	dy
Perhaps a European observatory should be created so that the specific practices of the Member States and the application of European policy can be better monitored ?	dy
We can condemn and we can make demands , but what we need to do , and can do , as a Parliament , is to come up with new ideas .	dy
There would have to be alternatives , but surely it can be done .	dy

The European Parliament , the Council , the Commission and the Court of Justice are our institutions , and they provide the guarantees and the checks and balances without which nothing lasting can be built .	dy
That is the only way we can make Europe into a true union of diversities .	dy
Only then can we effectively combat discrimination in all the fields of human life .	dy
I hope we can still convince people of this and make progress , in order to win the day on this issue at Nice .	dy
If Europe can accept Turkey for what it is and welcome it into the European family , with all its differences , it will , I think , have made a quantum political and cultural leap .	dy
I thank Mr Parish for his report and wish his report all the best to ensure that we can follow up these important decisions taken by him in a specific and constructive manner .	dy

How can it be believed that an area of democracy , security and justice can be developed when repressive solutions directed against refugees are consistently chosen ?	dy
I really hope that we can find some solutions so that the Commission , the Council and Parliament can concentrate on issues of political importance .	dy
The same , of course , applies to parallel imports , since the agreement leaves this open to WTO members to decide what can or cannot be done .	dy
We believe that with this cooperation , between the Commission , the European Parliament and the Member States , we can establish a comprehensive approach .	dy
We are sure that we can maintain the necessary pace while simultaneous achieving the understanding and the support required for fully effective implementation of the essential changes .	dy
Let us recreate the core of democracy whereby the electorate can go to the polls and new majorities can be obtained and new laws adopted .	dy
Furthermore , there is huge scope for gaining business in the rest of the world for European suppliers of equipment and systems , if the industry can seize the opportunity .	dy
This can only be achieved if there are significant levels of participation , if the allocation instruments are transparent , and if everyone , from Finland to Sicily and Greece , knows what his or her position is .	dy
This can only happen if we succeed in setting up permanent support targeted at producer organisations and within a stable framework , namely the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables .	dy
How can the new Member States be successfully integrated into the common agricultural policy ?	dy
We intend to make the best progress we possibly can with the work , and if possible complete it in November .	dy
They must develop ways to assess aid schemes , whereas the Commission , for its part , intends to help this process by providing a forum where experiences can be shared .	dy
We do not think that in general these services should be exempt from the competition rules , as has just been said , but that where the picture is unclear , clarity can be achieved .	dy
Do the honourable Members really believe that this can be done ?	dy
It is equally the case that most of the things that America wants are more likely to be achieved if America can work with the European Union .	dy
If we can encourage the national parliaments and national authorities to give more information , then we have some hope .	dy
I hope that it can .	dy
That is what they did in Afghanistan and in Iraq , putting their trust in their military strength , which nothing in the European Union can match .	dy
We must find out why countries like Sweden and Finland can do that whilst other countries cannot .	dy
I therefore propose that besides defining high-risk groups , we should also allow those that can afford to do so to purchase vaccine .	dy
Consumers can easily imagine that the only way of preventing unjustified price increases is through sufficient competition .	dy
I think we have to make sure that we look at this and that we have a system by which we can license these products .	dy
As you can imagine , if we slow down , we will never finish .	dy
Surely it is time for governments to focus on creating the right conditions so that , when jobs are lost , entrepreneurs can come along and create new jobs .	dy
can we succeed in arriving at a rule for consumers ?	dy
We must consider how we can produce food and make it available .	dy
This circumstance must be remedied immediately before any further discharge can be granted .	dy
Let us hope we can .	dy
Several of the countries have a long way to go before they succeed in getting to the stage where they can become full members .	dy
Furthermore , unchecked consumption of non-renewable energy can directly and indirectly contribute to environmental problems like global warming , air pollution and other potentially disastrous scenarios .	dy
The targets proposed by the Committee on the Environment can be achieved because there are alternatives .	dy
