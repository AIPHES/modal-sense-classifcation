It is a human virtue to express concern on human rights issues in the world , but the American authorities - after massacring thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan under the excuse of fighting terrorism which is still continuing - can not expect the people of the world to take seriously the annual report issued by their Department of State on human rights .	de
They can not , therefore , blame the world for viewing such reports as a tool to advance America 's foreign policy .	de

Furthermore , there is huge scope for gaining business in the rest of the world for European suppliers of equipment and systems , if the industry can seize the opportunity .	dy
This can only be achieved if there are significant levels of participation , if the allocation instruments are transparent , and if everyone , from Finland to Sicily and Greece , knows what his or her position is .	dy

We do not think that in general these services should be exempt from the competition rules , as has just been said , but that where the picture is unclear , clarity can be achieved .	dy
Do the honourable Members really believe that this can be done ?	dy
It is equally the case that most of the things that America wants are more likely to be achieved if America can work with the European Union .	dy
If we can encourage the national parliaments and national authorities to give more information , then we have some hope .	dy
I hope that it can .	dy
That is what they did in Afghanistan and in Iraq , putting their trust in their military strength , which nothing in the European Union can match .	dy
We must find out why countries like Sweden and Finland can do that whilst other countries cannot .	dy
I therefore propose that besides defining high-risk groups , we should also allow those that can afford to do so to purchase vaccine .	dy
Consumers can easily imagine that the only way of preventing unjustified price increases is through sufficient competition .	dy
I think we have to make sure that we look at this and that we have a system by which we can license these products .	dy
As you can imagine , if we slow down , we will never finish .	dy
Surely it is time for governments to focus on creating the right conditions so that , when jobs are lost , entrepreneurs can come along and create new jobs .	dy
