A quota is a right to emit a certain quantity of climate gases during a certain period and this right can be sold on a market .	dy
The advantages are that the authorities can set a ceiling on all emissions .	dy
Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions .	de

Hence you can hardly speak of a '' targeting error '' when a Red Cross warehouse , although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof , was shelled twice by US aircraft .	dy
