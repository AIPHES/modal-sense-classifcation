Thus , among other things , we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds .	de
After all , I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment , defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf , then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf .	de
To act ethically , you must first be able to act at all .	de
It is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently to deformation ; therefore , their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can be evaluated .	de
Indeed , Lane â€™ s ( 1955 ) argument that a stream will restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baselevel change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade , then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel , the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished .	de
Therefore , an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone .	de
Pattern change alone is not sufficient evidence for active tectonics , rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence and / or surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation .	de
Therefore , care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies .	de
